		<p>Git is a source code version control system. Such a system is most useful when you work in a team, but even when you’re working alone, it’s a very useful tool to keep track of the changes you have made to your code.</p>

	<section class="main-section nav-link" id="Configuring_your_git_environment"><header>Configuring your git environment</header>
		<p>Tell git your name and email:

			<code>
				git config --global user.name "Your Full Name"
				git config --global user.email you@somewhere.com
			</code>
		
		Git stores this information in the ~/.gitconfig file. You may also want to set the EDITOR environment variable to vim or emacs; this controls which editor you use to enter log messages.

	<section class="main-section nav-link" id="creating_a_project"><header>Creating a Project</header>
	<p>Let’s create a new directory, ~/tmp/test1, for our first git project.

		<code>
			cd
			mkdir tmp
			cd tmp
			mkdir test1
			cd test1
		</code>
	
	Put the directory under git revision control:<code>
		git init
	</code>
	If you type ll (I’ll assume that ll is an alias for ls -alF), you will see that there is a .git directory. The git repository for the current directory is stashed in the .git directory.

	<section class="main-section nav-link" id="modifying_files"><header>Modifying files</header>
		<p>
		Modify hello.c to print “bye world” instead, and run git status. It reports that the file is “Changed but not updated.” This means that the file has been modified since the last commit, but it is still not ready to be committed because it has not been moved into the staging area.
		In git, a file must first go to the staging area before it can be committed. Before we move it to the staging area, let’s see what we changed in the file:
			<code>
				git diff
			</code>
		

		Or, if your terminal supports color,

			<code>
				git diff --color
			</code>
		

		The output should tell you that you took out the “hello world” line, and added a “bye world” line, like this:

			<code>
				-printf("%s\n", "hello world");
				+printf("%s\n", "bye world");
			</code>
		
		We move the file to the staging area with git add command:
			<code>
				git add hello.c
			</code>
		

		In git, “add” means this: move the change you made to the staging area. The change could be a modification to a tracked file, or it could be a creation of a brand new file. This is a point of confusion for those of you who are familiar with other version control systems such as Subversion. At this point, git diff will report no change. Our change—from hello to bye—has been moved into staging already. So this means that git diff reports the difference between the staging area and the working copy of the file. To see the difference between the last commit and the staging area, add --cached option:

			<code>
				git diff --cached
			</code>
		

		Let’s commit our change. If your commit message is a one-liner, you can skip the editor by giving the message directly as part of the git commit command:

			<code>
				git commit -m "changed hello to bye"
			</code>
		

		To see your commit history:
			<code>
				git log
			</code>
		
		You can add a brief summary of what was done at each commit:

			<code>
				git log --stat --summary
			</code>
		
		Or you can see the full difference at each commit:
			<code>
				git log -p
			</code>
		
		And in color:
			<code>
				git log -p --color
			</code>
		
		</p>

	<section class="main-section nav-link" id="the_tracked,_the_modified_and_the_staged"><header>The tracked, the modified and the staged</header>
		<p>
		A file in a directory under git revision control is either tracked or untracked. A tracked file can be unmodified, modified but unstaged, or modifed and staged. Confused? Let’s try again. There are four possibilities for a file in a git-controlled directory:
		<ul>
			<li>Untracked Object: Files and executable Files that can be rebuilt are usually not tracked.</li>

			<li>Tracked, unmodified: The file is in the git repository, and it has not been modified since the last commit. git status says nothing about the file.</li>

			<li>Tracked, modified, but unstaged: You modified the file, but didn’t git add the file. THe change has not been staged, so it’s not ready for commit yet.</li>
			<li>Tracked, modified, and staged: You modified the file, and did git add the file. THe change has been moved to the staging area. It is ready for commit. The staging area is also called the “index.”</li>

			<li>Thats all.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
	</section>

	<section class="main-section nav-link" id="other_useful_git_commands"><header>Other useful git commands</header>
		<p>
			Here are some more git commands that you will find useful. To rename a tracked file:
				<code>
					git mv old-filename new-filename
				</code>
			
			To remove a tracked file from the repository:
				<code>
					git rm filename
				</code>
			
			The mv or rm actions are automatically staged for you, but you still need to git commit your actions.
			Sometimes you make some changes to a file, but regret it, and want to go back to the version last committed. If the file has not been staged yet, you can do:
				<code>
					git checkout -- filename
				</code>
			
			If the fille has been staged, you must first unstage it:
				<code>
					git reset HEAD filename
				</code>
			
			Theere are two ways to display a manual page for a git command. For example, for the git status command, you can type one of the following two commands:
				<code>
					git help status
					man git-status
				</code>
			
			Lastly, git grep searches for specified patterns in all files in the repository. To see all places you called printf():
				<code>
					git grep printf
				</code>

	<section class="main-section nav-link" id="cloning_a_project"><header>Cloning a Project</header>
		<p>
		You created a brand new project in the test1 directory, added a file, and modifed the file. But more often than not, a programmer starts with an existing code base. When the codebase is under git version control, you can clone the whole repository. Let’s move up one directory, clone test1 into test2, and cd into the test2 directory:
			<code>
				cd ..
				git sclone test1 test2
				cd test2
			</code>
		
		Type ll to see that your hello.c file is cloned here. Moreover, if you run git log, you will see that the whole commit history is replicated here. git clone not only copies the latest version of the files, but also copies the entire repository, including the entire commit history. After cloning, the two repositories are indistinguishable. Let’s make some changes—and let’s be bad. Edit hello.c to replace printf with printf%^&, save and commit:
		pre

			<code>
				vim hello.c
				git add hello.c
				git commit -m "hello world modification - work in progress"
			</code>
		
		Now run git log to see your recent commit carrying on the commit history that was cloned.
		If you want to see only the commits after cloning:

			<code>
				git log origin..
			</code>
		

		Of course you can add -p and --color to see the full differnce  in color:
			<code>
				git log -p --color origin..
			</code>
		
		Let’s make one more modification. Fix the printf, and perhaps change the “bye world” to “rock my world” while we’re there.
			<code>
				vim hello.c
				git add hello.c
				git commit -m "fixed typo & now prints rock my world
			</code>
		
		Run git log -p --color origin.. again to see the two commits you have made after cloning
		</p>

	<section class="main-section nav-link" id="adding_a_directory_to_your_repository"><header>Adding a directory to your repository</header>
		<p>
			Enter the original test1 directory, create the solution subdirectory, and add two files to it:

				<code>
					cd ../test1
					mkdir solution
					cd solution
					cp ../hello.c .
					echo ’hello:’ > Makefile
				</code>
			
		Type ll to see that two files—Makefile and hello.c—have been created in the solutions directory. (hello.c was copied from the parent directory, and Makefile was created directly on the command line using the echo command.Now, move out of the solution directory, and git add & git commit the solution directory:
			<code>
				cd ..
				git add solution
				git commit -m "added solution"
			</code>
		
		Note that git add solution stages all files in the directory.

	<section class="main-section nav-link" id="pulling_changes_from_a_remote_repository"><header>Pulling changes from a remote repository</header>
		<p>When others are working on the same project, you will often want to get updated files from a
		remote repository. You do that by “pulling” the changes in my repository into your repository.
		Let’s pull the changes we just made in test1 into test2:
			<code>
				cd ../test2/
				git pull
			</code>
		
		The git pull command looks at the original repository that you cloned from, fetches all the
		changes made since the cloning, and merges the changes into the current repository. You
		now have the solution right in your repository.
